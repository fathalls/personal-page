                  Creativity has a romantic flavour to it; this sudden
                  inspiration falling from the sky like Newton&#x27;s apple or
                  Archimedes&#x27;s Eureka. However, what these stories are
                  omitting, is the amount of work and discipline that had to be
                  put to come up with such discoveries.

                  Let&#x27;s go back to the definition of creativity: it&#x27;s
                  the ability to produce original and unusual ideas, or to make
                  something new or imaginative (Cf.{" "}

                  ). Such ideas can be the result of associating old ones,
                  tweaking them and coming up with something new.

                  Creativity can be obtained and nurtured by methodical
                  discipline; writing a technical article is a creative task,
                  coming up with system design for a side project is a creative
                  task, even debugging is a creative task!
